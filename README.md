# Neural-Networks-on-FPGA
Tutorial Series/Mini Project implementing neural networks on FPGA

## Index
- Hello World: Essentially a blinking LED tutorial on a BASYS 3 FPGA, but can be ported over to another FPGA without much difficulty. Serves as a nice introduction to folks without FPGA exposure.
- Neural Network Crash Course: Introduction to Neural Networks and the commonly used terms. A vast topic; the aim is to cover the basics and then move on to the project.
- CNN for Digit Recognition: CNN to be implmented in HW
- HDL implementation of CNN
- Porting over to FPGA
